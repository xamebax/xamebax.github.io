                        <h3>Who am I?</h3>
                        <p>Born in the eighties, I dreamed of becoming an astronaut already in kindergarten.
                        Born in the eighties <strong><i>in Eastern Europe</i></strong>, I quickly soaked up the ever present brutal realism,
                        and pragmatically pivoted to a slightly more realistic, but only slightly less romantic interest in astronomy.
                        This passion helped me survive through school and contributed to my decision to study the humanities.
                        It made perfect sense at the time.</p>
                        <p>After years of working and volunteering in a number of Polish NGOs and a various selection of odd jobs,
                        I moved to Berlin for a fresh start, and taught myself enough to get into software engineering. Currently in Oslo,
                        I'm still an engineer. After years of living in comfort an engineering life provides, I'm focusing on fighting climate change.
                         I'm a two-times immigrant, this is a process.</p>
                        <p><a href="https://thatmarta.wordpress.com/">I have a technical blog</a>, which I don't update as regularly as I'd like since
                        my crime is being a hobby maximalist. I used to blog more in Polish: 
                        <a href="https://paciorkowska.blogspot.com/">on politics, feminism</a> and, together with fellow activists,
                        on <a href="https://laikazine.wordpress.com/">animal rights</a> and guerrilla gardening (our blog, sadly, did not survive
                        when the blogging platform was discontinued; own your data is the universal lesson).</p>
                        <p>I think people are what they do, not who they say they are. So here's a selection of things I did that I would want to humbly
                        believe answer the titular question.</p>

                            2010 was also the year the first Polish vegetarian lifestyle magazine came to life. It's called <a href="https://vege.com.pl/">Vege</a>, and I was
                            lucky enough to be an editor for the first ten months. Sharing happy feels with my dad on that photo.</p>
